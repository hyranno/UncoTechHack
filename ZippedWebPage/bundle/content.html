Most web pages contain various files like HTML, scripts, CSS, images and so on.
Lots of files make lots of HTTP requests then make network slower.
To reduce the number of the requests, some bundlers like webpack are used.
This article proposes to use zip instead of bundler,
 for people who don't like installing or rellying on specific bundler.
Ideally, downloading bundle and storing caches of each files should be done on lower layer.
But for today, this article use JavaScript on browser to handle the zip.
<br /><br />
Let's begin with the overview.
<ol>
  <li>
    Browser downloads the initial page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Script on the initial page requests the zip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Script attaches the file contents to the page,
     getting the files from the zip instead of HTTP requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the appended page includes more dependancy to other files, repeat 3.
  </li>
</ol>

This page itself is a sample implementation of this concept.
Following texts show more details based on this implementation.
This implementation may be not perfect, so take it just as a sample or a help for understanding.
You can take a look at the source of this page,
 and <a href="resources/bundle.zip">bundle.zip</a> which is downloaded with this page.
<br /><br />
At first browser downloads the initial page.
What the initial page should contain are
  some light weight HTML for the initial rendering,
  scripts to download the zip with ajax,
  and the scripts to handle the zip.
Requesting the zip file is nothing more than well-known ajax.
Just remember the zip is binary file so get it as a blob, dataURI, or something like that.
The <a href="https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/">zip.js by gildas-lormeau</a> is used in this page to handle zip.
It includes file systems for zip, not only deflate/inflate algorithms.
<br /><br />
The contents should not make HTTP requests by itself, and should have "which file in the zip is needed" and "where to attach it."
So when your content HTML includes
<code class="multiline delete">  &lt;script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;img src="image.png"&gt;</code>
then it should be replased with
<code class="multiline add">  &lt;script data-zip-path="script.js" data-zip-target="src" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link data-zip-path="style.css" data-zip-target="href" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;img data-zip-path="image.png" data-zip-target="src"&gt;</code>
and script can attach the dataURI of the decompressed file to the target attribute.
Scripts will not be evaluated when their "src" attribute changed,
 thus you will have to create another element,
 like this page does it with MutationObserver.
<br /><br />
Not only HTML, but also CSS will makes some requests for images.
When your CSS includes <code class="delete">url("image.png")</code>
 replase it with variable <code class="add">var(--image_png)</code>, then add
<code class="multiline add">  &lt;datalist data-zip-cssvars="true"&gt;
    &lt;data value="image.png"&gt;--image_png&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/datalist&gt;</code>
to your HTML and script can attach the dataURI of the decompressed file to the CSS variable.
<br /><br />
In case the page dynamically changes or contains recursive file inclusion,
 you have to attach the decompressed files time to time.
So watching the page using MutationObserver for new nodes with "data-zip-path" attribute may work.
